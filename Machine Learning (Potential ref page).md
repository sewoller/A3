Machine learning and explainable AI (XAI) are useful tools for cognitive enhancement. They enable personalized learning and ethical decision-making. 

In the field of academic research, some express worries that employing language models such as [OpenAI's ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) may raise issues related to ethical boundaries or compliance. Similarly, some artists claim that image generating models such as [OpenAI's DALL E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2) are violating intellectual property. Others would argue that the models are doing a similar thing to what human artists do by "taking inspiration" from existing work to create their own. 

As per personalized learning, language models can be used as an unreliable tutor who would be constantly available, but not always correct. The models can help students by giving them ideas to think about and reflect on but are generally not used to obtain direct answers.

This paper [[Holstein et al. (2018).pdf]] works through an iterative, participatory design process with K-12 teachers than results in Lumilo. Lumilo are mixed-reality smartglasses that augment the information K-12 teachers can see about their students so that they can better manage their time when teaching in ‘divergent’ or ‘personalized’ classrooms, that is, classrooms where students are working on different tasks tailored to their needs. In specific, Lumilo interfaces with intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs), which provide students with detailed instructions through learning activities for them to work through at their own pace, to allow teachers to see information about the students’ learning and behaviour on the ITS to better determine who may need their support and attention. Overall, tests comparing teaching with the final version of Lumilo to teaching without Lumilo indicated that Lumilo may successfully aid teacher’s in directing their attention to the students who show the lowest learning outcomes when working on ITSs alone, i.e. the students who may benefit the most from a teacher’s support.

**Main take-away:** smartglasses may be used to provide teachers with additional information about how their students are performing on online learning tasks, which can help them better manage their time in the classroom.Obsidian Git: Commit all changes

This paper [[3571884.3604317.pdf]] explores the idea of using intelligent personal assistants (IPA) (Amazon Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant etc.) as a tool for improving [[Time Management]]. Current IPA's posses enough functionality to carry out basic time management tasks such as scheduling something in a users calendar or sending a text message when prompted, but the authors of this paper conceptualize an IPA that is able to work proactively to enhance time management.

This study was carried out in the form of an expert discussion where ideas about proactive IPAs were shared with two professors, two associate professors and three PhD candidates. All of these experts have described significant levels of interest in fields related to the further development of IPAs. The discussion was carried out in person over a period of roughly 90 minutes where the responses from each participant were recorded, coded and anonymized. 

Following the discussion, thematic analysis was carried out on the data which helped categorize the findings into 4 distinct categories:
1) Individual Time Management
2) Multiparty Interaction
3) Human-Assistant Interaction
4) User Modelling
Each of these categories serve to highlight distinct ways in which IPAs might be improved to incorporate more proactive methods of time management.

Individual Time Management refers to

This paper, [[Ahmed et al. (2014).pdf]], describes a system that experiments with the the effects of a physical representation of time in a p[] [[Time Management]]. Their theory is that, because time is subjective and hard to represent internally, the flawed human perception of the passage of time can be detrimental to time management skills. Their proposed solution is a physical representation of time that would help the participant keep track of time and improve their time management skills. 
Their device is a machine that uses marbles to represent chunks of time. The device would be used to help the user estimate the amount of time a task would take to complete, and how much time the user took to complete the task. Each marble represents a 30 minute interval. The user would fill a cylinder with the amount of marbles they estimate would be necessary to complete the task. There are multiple cylinders, so the user could estimate/complete multiple tasks easily. When in use, the user locks in an activity (method unspecified) which tells the device which activity they are working on. After 25 minutes locked in on an activity, the device drops one marble from the specified cylinder into the finished pile. The user then has 5 minutes to take a break, during which they could switch to a different activity if they would like. If the last marble has been dropped, the user would get an auditory notification from the device.

This paper focuses on the effectiveness of time management applications at improving the efficiency of getting work done by regulating the type of notifications showed based on the user's location. By recognizing the pattern between a user's location and their focus on task completion, smartphones can then adapt to being less distractive by limiting their notifications for instance. Improving time management is directly related to an improved academic and work performance, live a more efficient life, and deal with less emotionally stress as shown by [[College Students' Time Management - Correlations With Academic Performance and Stress.pdf]] which suggests this is worth pursuing.

For the experiments, 2 devices are used: the smartphone and smartwatch. The smartphone gets notifications and tracts the user's location but filters out any distractive/unnecessary notifications to send to the smartwatch. Therefore the smartwatch only shows task status and completion.

For certain apps like phone calls or SMS texts, the smartphone will beep or ring to notify the user. In this case, the time spent distracted while working is recorded and included as part of the analysis. With this, 3 main patterns were found:

1. After the ringing or popping up of some notifications, Jonathan is attracted by the smartphone and spends some time on it.
2. Although there are some notifications popping up on the smartphone, Jonathan still concentrate on working.
3. Although there is no notification popping up on the smartphone, Jonathan is still distracted by the smartphone.

Along with this, 3 other factors were recorded.

First are smartphone-related factors. This includes notifications that caused the distraction or general app usage for when the user gets bored.

Second are task-related factors. This deals with finding and analyzing patterns such as at what point during the task was the user the most or least focused/distracted.

Third are external factors. These include the location, time during the day, and special occasions like weekends, holidays, user's occupation, etc.

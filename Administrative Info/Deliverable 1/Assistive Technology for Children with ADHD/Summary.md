Summary of [[Initial Validation of an Assistive Technology to Enhance Executive Functioning Among Children with ADHD.pdf]]

This paper focuses on assisting children with ADHD in improving their ability to time manage and focus on doing their morning routines without forgetting or being distracted. It proposes TangiPan, a prototype of a system designed to make tasks more engaging, consisting of six objects representing different tasks and a tablet application.

The paper mentions other experiments done to improve such executive tasks, few of them are tailored for those diagnosed ADHD. The case study was done on 2 children, one for 2 weeks and the other for 4 weeks, where the research assistants explained the system in the beginning them came back at the end of the time period to collect data and ask the participants, including the parents, to fill out a questionnaire.

TangiPan works by using six objects, reach representing a task, and a tablet application used to plan the tasks and their execution stages during the morning routine. Ideally, the child would map each object to a morning task and set an estimate time to complete it

Results and Conclusion:

There was noticeable improvement with the 2 children's performance in time management, goal-setting, and improved task completion. The autonomy provided also gave the children an improved sense of satisfaction and decreased conflict with their parents. Though the dataset was small and the prototype had a few issues like durability, battery life, etc., it nonetheless offered valuable insight into its effectiveness and potential with further research, investment, and development.

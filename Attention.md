[Attention](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/attention#google_vignette) is defined as notice, thought, or interest. In a neuroscience context, it is described as [the ability to actively process specific information in the environment while tuning out other details.](https://verywellmind.com/what-is-attention-2795009) The process of attention, and what gives us the ability to choose what to focus on, is a mystery in the field of neuroscience that many have tried to unravel. Since attention is such an important part of learning and skill, people have frequently tried to enhance their attention in many different ways. 

There are many types of attention that are used in different circumstances. 
- **Focused Attention**: focus on a stimulus, often external
	- i.e. notice an alarm going off, find the source and reason
- **Sustained Attention**: focus on a single stimulus for a period of time
	- i.e. test-taking
- **Selective Attention**: focus on one stimulus while ignoring others
	- i.e. working while in a coffeeshop
- **Alternating Attention**: change attention between two or more stimuli
	- i.e. taking care of kids
- **Divided (Limited) Attention**: multitasking, attend to multiple stimuli concurrently 
	- i.e. driving a car

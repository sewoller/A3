**Summary of [[Time Flies - Paper.pdf]]**
  
In this research from 2000, the focus was on understanding user behavior toward information technologies, particularly the concept of cognitive absorption. Cognitive absorption captures the holistic user experience with new software and includes temporal dissociation. The study found support for the relationships between cognitive absorption, individual traits, and technology acceptance beliefs.

Implications for further research include refining the psychometric properties of the cognitive absorption construct and exploring additional antecedents and consequents of cognitive absorption. The study also encourages the use of longitudinal studies for a more in-depth analysis of cognitive absorption during human-computer interactions.

From a practical standpoint, the research emphasizes the importance of considering user experiences beyond utilitarian aspects when implementing information technologies. Managers should create an environment that encourages enjoyable technology use. Additionally, the design of information systems and training programs should focus on enhancing cognitive absorption. Finally, for web-based applications, cognitive absorption can be a valuable indicator of the quality of a website's user experience.


**Key points**
A state of intense focus & attention induced by high quality user interfaces (and overall HCI) will cause temporal dissociation.

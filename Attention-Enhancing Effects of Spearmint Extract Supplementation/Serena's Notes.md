notes from [[attention-enhancing effects of spearmint extract.pdf]]

- double-blind placebo-controlled trial of health men and women, 142 participants
- nootropics: cognitive-enhancing herbal preparations and medications
- Method:
	- 900mg of extract with breakfast, or a placebo (both were capsules) for 90 days
	- daily diary entries
	- Cognitive Assessments at each check-in
	- sleep, mood, and quality of life assessments
- Results
	- improved attention by day 30, improvements were maintained for the remaining duration of the study
	- improvements were shown in sustained and complex attention
	- no significant sleep differences
		- this is interesting because caffeine, which is another nootropic that improves attention, can significantly impact sleep

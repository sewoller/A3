(Time management - quick description) -> give context on what we're looking at



Supports for [[Time Management]] and [[Attention]] have been studied for decades and can vary from paper planners and their software equivalents to wearables and nootropics - see [[Systems]] for an overview of a subset of existing systems that researchers have created.

Research has also been dedicated to learning more about how people use existing tools and systems for time management: see [[Guidelines for Future Time Management Systems]].

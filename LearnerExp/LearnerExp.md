This research carried out in 2019 looked to identify how different [time management]() behaviors exhibited in students can have an impact on their expected academic performance. Remote online learning has become more prevalent in recent years and as a result learners are less supervised which can lead to challenges with time management. The goal of this research was to focus on being able to measure and visualize trends in time management behavior among online students.

Using data collected from a university Learning Management System (LMS), researchers first developed consistent methods for visualizing the data. This data consisted of logs which detailed each individual learners interaction with the LMS including:
	1) Engagement with course content (Videos, slide decks, etc.)
	2) Time spent attending remote lectures
	3) Amount of interaction with other learners on the platform (chat & forum interaction)

This data was used to create an "Activity Vector" which was recorded for each learner each day to create a calendar like display plotting the

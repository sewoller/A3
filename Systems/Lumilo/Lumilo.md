Lumilo is a [[Wearable Technology]] [[Time Management]] system developed by [[Holstein et al. (2018).pdf]] that utilizes mixed-reality smartglasses to augment the information that K-12 teachers can see about their students so that they can more accurately assess the needs of their students and how to manage their time and attention accordingly. In specific, Lumilo works in ‘divergent’ or ‘personalized’ classrooms where students are working on different tasks tailored to their needs through an intelligent tutoring system (ITS), which provides students with detailed instructions through learning activities for them to work through at their own pace. By interfacing with an ITS, Lumilo presents teachers with information about each student's progress through their activity and their behaviour online (such as  'distracted'), which can help inform the teachers' choice of student to spend time with and help. Overall, tests comparing teaching with Lumilo to teaching without Lumilo indicated that Lumilo may successfully aid teachers in directing their attention to the students who show the lowest learning outcomes when working on ITSs alone, i.e. the students who may benefit the most from a teacher’s support.

**Key Points**
- Smartglasses may be used to overlay information about each students' work that may be hard for teachers to see otherwise.
- The additional information from the smartglasses can help teacher's more efficiently manage their time to help the students who may benefit the most from their support.

**Examples of System**
Teacher view when using the system. The system has two modes: a simple (left) and elaborate (right) mode, which shows basic information about the whole class or more in-depth information about a particular students' performance, toggled by a remote and the teacher's gaze.

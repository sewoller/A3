This paper, [[Ahmed et al. (2014).pdf]], describes a system that experiments with the effects of a physical representation of [[Time Management]]. Their theory is that, because time is subjective and hard to represent internally, the flawed human perception of the passage of time can be detrimental to time management skills. Their proposed solution is a physical representation of time that would help the participant keep track of time and improve their time management skills. 
Their device is a machine that uses marbles to represent chunks of time. The device would be used to help the user estimate the amount of time a task would take to complete, and how much time the user took to complete the task. Each marble represents a 30 minute interval. The user would fill a cylinder with the amount of marbles they estimate would be necessary to complete the task. There are multiple cylinders, so the user could estimate/complete multiple tasks easily. When in use, the user locks in an activity (method unspecified) which tells the device which activity they are working on. After 25 minutes locked in on an activity, the device drops one marble from the specified cylinder into the finished pile. The user then has 5 minutes to take a break, during which they could switch to a different activity if they would like. If the last marble has been dropped, the user would get an auditory notification from the device.

  
This paper, titled "A Tangible Approach to Time Management", [[Ahmed et al. (2014).pdf]], introduces a novel approach to address the challenges associated with time management. The central premise is that the human perception of time is inherently subjective and often inaccurate, leading to suboptimal [[time management]]. To mitigate this issue, the authors propose a tangible solution involving a time representation device.

Their innovation comprises a mechanical apparatus that employs marbles to symbolize discrete time intervals, each representing 30 minutes. Users can employ this device to estimate the duration required for specific tasks and monitor their progress effectively. The process involves selecting an appropriate number of marbles and placing them in a designated container, which may hold several sets for concurrent task estimation.

Once users engage in an activity (the activation method is not specified), the device initiates a 25-minute countdown. Upon the completion of this period, it drops one marble from the designated container into a 'finished' pile. The users then begin a 5-minute break, during which they can either relax or transition to another task. Should the last marble be released, an auditory alert from the device signals the end of the session, ensuring that users remain aware of their time management goals.

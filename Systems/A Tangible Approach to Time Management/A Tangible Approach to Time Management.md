This paper, [[Ahmed et al. (2014).pdf]], introduces a novel approach to address the challenges associated with time management. The central premise is that the human perception of time is inherently subjective and often inaccurate, leading to suboptimal [[time management]]. To mitigate this issue, the authors propose a tangible solution involving a time representation device.

Their innovation comprises a mechanical apparatus that employs marbles to symbolize discrete time intervals, each representing 30 minutes. Users can employ this device to estimate the duration required for specific tasks and monitor their progress effectively. The process involves selecting an appropriate number of marbles and placing them in a designated container, which may hold several sets for concurrent task estimation.

Once users engage in an activity (the activation method is not specified), the device initiates a 25-minute countdown. Upon the completion of this period, it drops one marble from the designated container into a 'finished' pile. The users then begin a 5-minute break, during which they can either relax or transition to another task. Should the last marble be released, an auditory alert from the device signals the end of the session, ensuring that users remain aware of their time management goals.

The researchers' subsequent phase involves assessing the model's efficacy through user testing and investigating its impact on behavioral change.

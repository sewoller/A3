This paper [[Jeromela and Conlan (2023).pdf]] explores the idea of using intelligent personal assistants (IPA) (Amazon Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant etc.) as a tool for improving [[Time Management]]. Current IPA's posses enough functionality to carry out basic time management tasks such as scheduling something in a users calendar or sending a text message when prompted, but the authors of this paper conceptualize an IPA that is able to work proactively to enhance time management.

This study was carried out in the form of an expert discussion where ideas about proactive IPAs were shared with two professors, two associate professors and three PhD candidates. All of these experts have described significant levels of interest in fields related to the further development of IPAs. The discussion was carried out in person over a period of roughly 90 minutes where the responses from each participant were recorded, coded and anonymized. 

Following the discussion, thematic analysis was carried out on the data which helped categorize the findings into 4 distinct categories:
1) Individual Time Management
2) Multiparty Interaction
3) Human-Assistant Interaction
4) User Modelling
Each of these categories serve to highlight distinct ways in which IPAs might be improved to incorporate more proactive methods of time management. Below is a diagram that provides more information on the individual categories and shows how categories interconnect.

Individual Time Management refers to ways in which an IPA could help a user manage time more effectively for tasks that do not involve any third party interaction, such as scheduling time for physical activity. Based on the findings from their discussion, researchers further dissected this category into 3 different levels of time management based on data requirements and complexity of implementation. The first level represents basic functionality such as asking an IPA to take down items in a list like format. The second level is an IPA that would be able to produce insights about a users calendar such as identifying potential timing conflicts, but would ultimately leave the user in control of their own schedule. The final level introduces autonomy into the IPA, wherein a user could give the IPA permission to make adjustments to a schedule given contextual information like staying late at the office or getting stuck in traffic. 

Multiparty Interaction refers to tasks that would require interaction not only between and IPA and its user but also other humans and potentially their IPAs as well. Examples of these tasks include asking your IPA to schedule a meeting with a colleague or proactively sending an email to notify of a late arrival if the user is running behind schedule. Several criticisms of this functionality were noted in the discussion which largely involved privacy concerns associated with the sharing of calendars. Another criticism was raised which related to the social implication of having and IPA act on your behalf. One expert mentioned that it may be perceived as rude or insincere to have an artificial assistant schedule a meeting on a users behalf.

The third category titled Human-Assistant Interaction, refers to an IPAs ability to sense contextual clues for the most effective way to interact with its user. The authors give the example of an IPA understanding when a user is driving and consequently giving notifications or requesting information from the user via voice interaction. The main concerns raised by the discussion group surrounded the IPAs ability to accurately deduce the correct method of interaction based on contextual cues. They agreed that a voice prompted notification informing a user of a calendar change could be intrusive and interrupting in many different situations.

The final category of functionality is User Modelling, which refers to the ability of an IPA to responsibly use data collected from a user. Several participants in the discussion noted the risk that lies in the collection of user data by an IPA. The benefit afforded by this risk is realized in an IPAs ability to use [[Machine Learning]] models to learn and make changes to better suit the users preferred style of time management. Several other discussion participants argued that incorporating this functionality would introduce too much risk especially in the context of inter-human interaction.


**Key Points**
	- Intelligent Personal Assistants (IPA) currently exist and provide very basic levels of time management functionality to users.
	- Researchers propose that adding advance levels of functionality to IPAs could have significant benefits for time management.
	- An expert discussion was carried out which helped identify potential benefits and risks associated with these increased capabilities

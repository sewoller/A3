Time management is a person's ability to work efficiently or to prioritize tasks when under time pressure. 

People do not always agree on the optimal strategies to best manage time. That being said, it is generally agreed upon that the following tools and strategies are helpful:
- Setting goals in the form of a to do list
- Creating a schedule (ex: Google Calendar)
- Time tracking 

However, one must be careful not to spend more time scheduling than working. As a comparison, the Linux operating system developers had to optimize the scheduler because it is suboptimal to spend too much time organizing the tasks rather than doing them. Similarly, using the previously mentioned tools and strategies can be helpful but should not be overdone.

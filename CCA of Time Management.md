Time management is generally a set of behaviours for the allocation of time for the effective performance of tasks, with benefits such as improvement in academic and job performance, health, and satisfaction with work and the reduction of stress [[Lund and Wiese (2021).pdf]].

Supports for [[Time Management]] and [[Attention]] have been studied for decades and can vary from paper planners and their software equivalents to wearables and nootropics - see [[Systems]] for an overview of a subset of existing systems that researchers have created.

Research has also been dedicated to learning more about how people use existing tools and systems for time management: see [[Guidelines for Future Time Management Systems]].

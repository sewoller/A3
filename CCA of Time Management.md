Time management is generally a set of behaviours that aim to use time effectively when performing tasks.

Time management is defined as a set of “behaviours that aim at achieving an effective use of time while performing certain goal-directed activities”. These skills are important and valuable. Past work has shown that the application of time management strategies is positively correlated with academic performance and job performance. Furthermore, time management strategies have been shown to positively relate to stress-related outcomes including perceived control of time, job satisfaction, and health

Some helpful definitions for along the way:
- [[Time Management]]
- [[Attention]]
- [[Machine Learning]]
- [[Wearable Technology]]

Supports for [[Time Management]] and [[Attention]] have been studied for decades and can vary from paper planners and their software equivalents to wearables and nootropics - see [[Systems]] for an overview of a subset of existing systems that researchers have created.

Research has also been dedicated to learning more about how people use existing tools and systems for time management: see [[Guidelines for Future Time Management Systems]].

Lumilo is a system that utilizes mixed-reality smartglasses to augment the information that K-12 teachers can see about their students so that they assess more accurately the needs of their students and how to manage their time and attention accordingly. In specific, Lumilo works in ‘divergent’ or ‘personalized’ classrooms where students are working on different tasks tailored to their needs through an intelligent tutoring system (ITS), which provides students with detailed instructions through learning activities for them to work through at their own pace. By interfacing with an ITS, Lumilo presents teachers with information about each student's progress through their activity and their behaviour online (such as  'distracted'), which can help inform the teachers' choice of student to spend time with and help. Overall, tests comparing teaching with Lumilo to teaching without Lumilo indicated that Lumilo may successfully aid teachers in directing their attention to the students who show the lowest learning outcomes when working on ITSs alone, i.e. the students who may benefit the most from a teacher’s support.

**Main take-away:** smartglasses may be used to provide teachers with additional information about how their students are performing on online learning tasks, which can help them better manage their time in the classroom.Obsidian Git: Commit all changes
